Commonplace app built with Ruby on Rails.

# about

Commonplace lets you import your Amazon kindle highlights into the app. Once in
the appp, you can favorite and tag highlights to organize them. You can also add
notes. In addition to importing book highlights, you can create your own
highlights (or tidbits worth noting) by adding your own "sources". Sources from
kindle highlights are Books, but you can add podcasts, lectures, artists, etc
(it's open ended).
